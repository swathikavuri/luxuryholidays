      The UK Government has provided clarity on the traffic light system and entry requirements for destinations with international travel set to resume soon.<br><br> Now that we have the facts, we can provide you with latest travel information for the destinations you are planning to travel to. The rules currently in place are based on returning to England. The government has announced that the traffic light status of destinations will be reviewed regularly every 3 weeks from 17 May with the traffic light policy itself reviewed at the end of June, July and October.<br><br>
      We are continuing to monitor the situation closely and are advising guests to check the latest FCDO advice for full destination information.

      As pre-departure tests are required before leaving the UK and again on arrival back into the UK, we are recommending few companies who offer a comprehensive range of Covid testing services, either in one of their clinics or at your home.<br>
      The List recommended can be accessed here 
      <a style="text-decoration: underline; color:blue" href=" https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/987982/covid-private-testing-providers-general-testing-200521.csv/preview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOV List Recommendations</a><br><br>

      The tests are PHE approved, MHRA authorised and CE marked for quality and safety assurances. The tests are administered and couriered to the Laboratory, once results are processed, an automatic message is received and Certified results are emailed in a printable PDF format. Passengers can receive RT-PCR test results within 24-72 hours of providing swab sample, or within just 2-4 hours when using our â€˜Super Express Testâ€™ option at some of these clinics.
